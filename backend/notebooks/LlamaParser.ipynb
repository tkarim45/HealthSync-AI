    "- **patient_info**: Contains:\n",
    "  - **age**: The patient's age (e.g., \"3 Y 0 M 0 D\" or \"Unknown\").\n",
    "  - **gender**: The patient's gender (e.g., \"Male\", \"Female\", or \"Unknown\").\n",
    "- **haematology_results**: A list of tests, each with:\n",
    "  - **test**: Name of the test (e.g., \"Haemoglobin\").\n",
    "  - **patient_value**: The patient’s result (e.g., \"11.3\").\n",
    "  - **unit**: How it’s measured (e.g., \"g/dl\").\n",
    "  - **reference_value**: The normal range for the patient’s age and gender (e.g., \"11-14\").\n",
    "  - **remark**: Shows if the result is \"Normal\", \"Low\", or \"High\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests include:\n",
    "- Haemoglobin: How much oxygen the blood carries.\n",
    "- MCV: Size of red blood cells.\n",
    "- RBC Count: Number of red blood cells.\n",
    "- HCT: How much of the blood is red blood cells.\n",
    "- RDW: If red blood cells are different sizes.\n",
    "- WBC Count: Number of white blood cells that fight germs.\n",

    "The patient is {patient_age} old and {patient_gender}. They feel tired and look pale. No known sickness or bleeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Explain\n",
    "1. **Find Problems**: Look at the `remark` field (\"Low\" or \"High\") to see what’s not normal. Check `patient_value` against `reference_value`.\n",
    "2. **Keep It Short and Simple**:\n",
    "   - Say what’s wrong in 2-3 sentences (e.g., “Your red blood cells are too small.”).\n",
    "   - Use examples: “Red blood cells are like trucks carrying oxygen to your body.”\n",
    "   - Avoid medical words like “anemia” or “leukocytosis.”\n",
    "3. **Explain Why**:\n",
    "   - Say why it might be happening in 1-2 sentences, tailored for the patient’s age (e.g., for a child, “Maybe not enough iron from food”; for an adult, “Maybe stress or not enough iron”).\n",
    "   - Mention age-appropriate causes (e.g., iron deficiency for kids, infections for all ages).\n",
    "4. **What to Do**:\n",
    "   - Suggest 1-2 easy steps (e.g., “Get a test to check iron.”).\n",
    "   - Say why: “This will help make the blood stronger.”\n",
    "   - Adjust for age (e.g., “See a kids’ doctor” for children, “See your doctor” for adults).\n",
    "5. **When to Worry**:\n",
    "   - Say when to see a doctor quickly in 1 sentence (e.g., “If very tired, go to the doctor now.”).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "Write a short plain text explanation (no JSON or code blocks) with:\n",
    "- What’s wrong: 2-3 sentences about the problems.\n",
    "- Why it might be happening: 1-2 sentences about possible reasons.\n",
    "- What to do: 1-2 sentences with easy steps.\n",
    "- When to worry: 1 sentence about urgent signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safety\n",
    "- Use the normal ranges from the JSON for the patient’s age ({patient_age}) and gender ({patient_gender}).\n",
    "- Warn about serious problems (e.g., Haemoglobin <7 g/dL, Platelets <20 × 10⁹/L, WBC >20 × 10⁹/L) by saying “See a doctor right away.”\n",
    "- Don’t say it’s definitely one problem; suggest a doctor check.\n",
